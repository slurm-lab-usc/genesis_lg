## 🌟 Features

- **Totally based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym)**

- **Faster and Smaller**
  
  For a go2 walking on the plane task with 4096 envs, the training speed in Genesis is approximately **1.3x** compared to [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), while the graphics memory usage is roughly **1/2** compared to IsaacGym.

  With this smaller memory usage, it's possible to **run more parallel environments**, which can further improve the training speed.

- Incorporation of various methods in published RL papers

## 🧪 Test Results

For tests conducted on Genesis, please refer to [tests.md](./test_resources/tests.md)

## 🛠 Installation

1. Create a new python virtual env with python>=3.10
2. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
3. Install Genesis following the instructions in the [Genesis repo](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis)
4. Install genesis_lr
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lupinjia/genesis_lr.git
   cd genesis_lr
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 👋 Usage

### 🚀 Quick Start

By default, the task is set to `go2`(in `utils/helpers.py`), we can run a training session with the following command:

```bash
cd legged_gym/scripts
python train.py --headless # run training without rendering
```

After the training is done, paste the `run_name` under `logs/go2` to `load_run` in `go2_config.py`:

Then, run `play.py` to visualize the trained model:
